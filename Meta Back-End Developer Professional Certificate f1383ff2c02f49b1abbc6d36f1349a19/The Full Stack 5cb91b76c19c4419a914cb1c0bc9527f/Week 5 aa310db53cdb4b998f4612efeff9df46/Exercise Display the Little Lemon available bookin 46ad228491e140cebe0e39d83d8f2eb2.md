# Exercise: Display the Little Lemon available booking times

# Lab assets

You are provided with a basic setup for the Django environment for the project and app inside the zip file below.

The zip file contains an updated template to be used along with supportive files to run the lab.

[i-MIasIySeG2Cocad9Ln5Q_5227184237724d6c9bf5168d41950af1_Display-the-Little-Lemon-available-booking-times.zip](Exercise%20Display%20the%20Little%20Lemon%20available%20bookin%2046ad228491e140cebe0e39d83d8f2eb2/i-MIasIySeG2Cocad9Ln5Q_5227184237724d6c9bf5168d41950af1_Display-the-Little-Lemon-available-booking-times.zip)

Your goal is to implement reservation data retrieved from an API and update the HTML document to display the data using JavaScript.

# Objective

- Implement changes for updating the HTML form data using JavaScript

# Introduction

In parts one and two of the final assessment, you connected a model and built a form to accept reservation details from an end-user on the Little Lemon website. In this exercise, you must use JavaScript to perform the following actions:

- Create new bookings and refresh current bookings
- Refresh bookings for a date when the date is changed
- Dynamically process available time slots

# Initial lab instructions

This lab will require you to modify the following files:

- **views.py**
- **templates/bookings.html**

Starter code has already been added to the following files:

- **settings.py**
- **forms.py**
- **models.py**
- **urls.py (app-level)**
- **urls.py (project-level)**

Once you set up the project, make sure you oversee the contents of all the files and follow the steps accordingly. The zip file added here may contain some additional stylesheets and formatting so it is recommended to use it as the starter code instead of building on your existing project from part two.

You have already built the project named **littlelemon** and added an app inside the project called **restaurant**.

Follow the instructions below and ensure you check the output at every step.

<aside>
🤔 **Note:** *Make sure you have installed MySQL on your local machine and set up the admin user. In this lab, to keep it simple, you are going to begin with the root user with credentials. The root user by default has the password which is either **password** or **<blank>**. In case of a blank password, simply press Enter. The password will not be visible on screen as it’s being typed.*

</aside>

This is part three of the final assessment and it deals with utilizing JavaScript functionalities. It will include changes in the view logic and the booking template created for processing the booking form data.

# Steps

## Step 1

Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:

```jsx
pipenv shell
```

<aside>
🤔 **Note:** *Make sure you run the command in the main working directory containing the **manage.py** file.*

</aside>

## Step 2

To make sure you have the necessary dependencies in place, run the following commands inside **pipenv**:

```jsx
pipenv install django

pipenv install mysqlclient
```

## Step 3

Make sure you check the code inside all the supporting files you will need for the exercise. It includes a few changes from the endpoint of part two.

## Step 4

In the terminal run both commands to perform the migrations.

<aside>
🤔 **Note:** *Make sure you have created the correct MySQL user, assigned privileges, and configured the same database before you perform the migrations.*

</aside>

Run the necessary commands to make sure the user is created and can access the database. In case you are using the root user, make sure you have the correct password for the root user added inside the **settings.py** file

<aside>
🤔 **Note: ***The migrations performed here are not necessary as the changes are already in place. It is however a good practice to perform migrations before you begin working on a new code block. *****

</aside>

## Step 5

Open the file **views.py** and create a view function called **bookings()** below the **@csrf_exempt** decorator. Pass a request object to it as an argument.

<aside>
🤔 **Note:** *The necessary imports are already added inside the **views.py** file. URL configurations are already in place at the app-level **urls.py** file ****for ****the view function.*

</aside>

## Step 6

Inside the view function **`bookings()`**, add the following pseudo code:

- If value of **`request.method`** is equal to **`“POST”`**
    - Create a variable called **`data`** and assign it the value of **`json.load()`** with the **`request`** object passed as an argument.
    - Create a variable called **`exist`** and assign the following value to it:
        - **Booking.objects.filter(reservation_date=data['reservation_date']).filter( )**
        - Add the code below inside the **filter()** function above as an argument:
            - Create a variable **reservation_slot** and assign the value:
                - **data['reservation_slot']).exists()**
    - If the value of the **exist** variable is **False**:
        - Create a variable called **booking** and assign the value of the **Booking()** class object with the following code passed inside it:
            - **first_name=data['first_name'],**
            - **reservation_date=data['reservation_date'],**
            - **reservation_slot=data['reservation_slot'],**
        - Call the **save()** function over the **booking** variable using the dot operator.
    - Else return **HttpResponse()** with the following arguments passed inside it:
        - **"{'error':1}"** as a string
        - Variable **content_type** with the value equal to **'application/json'**
- Create a variable called **date** and assign it the value:
    - **request.GET.get('date',datetime.today().date())**
- Create a variable called **bookings** and assign it the value:
    - **Booking.objects.all().filter(reservation_date=date)**
- Create a variable called **booking_json** and assign it the value:
    - **serializers.serialize('json', bookings)**
- Return **HttpResponse()** with the following arguments passed inside it:
    - **booking_json**
- Variable **content_type** with the value equal to **'application/json'**

## Step 7

Save the **views.py** file and ensure the code has no errors and that you have followed the pseudo-code accurately.

## Step 8

Now step inside the **book.html** file and observe the code. There are three code blocks that you need to complete marked inside comments like:

**<!-- Part 1 -->**

You will be replacing the comments with the pseudo-code as specified in following four steps below.

## Step 9 (for part one)

Observe the code added inside the paragraph tag for the first name and replicate the code for the reservation date to replace the code block.

```jsx
<p>
            <!-- Step 9: Part one -->
              <label for="reservation_date">Reservation date:</label>
              <input type="date" placeholder="Reservation Date" required="" id="reservation_date">
            </p>
```

## Step 10 (for part two)

Call a function **getElementById()** over the **document** with **‘reservation_date’** passed inside it as an argument.

Continue on the same block of code and call the function **addEventListener()** on it as a suffix using dot operator and pass the following arguments to it:

**‘change’**

**function that contains the code: {getBookings()}**

```jsx
document.getElementById('reservation_date').addEventListener('change', getBookings)
```

## Step 11 (for part three)

Run a for loop on the constant **data**. Use a temporary variable called **item** to run the loop. Add the code inside the curly braces as follows:

- Call a **log()** function over the console and pass **item.fields** as an argument
- Call a **push()** function over **reserved_slots** array and pass the **item.fields.reservation_slot** to it as an argument

Update the **bookings** string variable with the code below:

**`<p>${item.fields.first_name} - ${formatTime(item.fields.reservation_slot)}</p>`**

```jsx
for (const item of data) {
          console.log(item.fields)
          reserved_slots.push(items.fields.reservation_slot)
          bookings += **`**<p>${item.fields.first_name} - ${formatTime(item.fields.reservation_slot)} </p>**`**
        }
```

## Step 12 (for part four)

Create a variable called **slot_options** and assign the following string to it:

**'<option value="0" disabled>Select time</option>'**

Run a for loop for numbers greater than **10** and less than **20** and add the following code inside the curly braces:

Create a constant called **label** and assign the function **formatTime()** to it with **i** passed ****inside it as an argument.

If value of **reserved.slots.includes(i)** is true add the code:

**slot_options += `<option value=${i} disabled>${label}</option>`**

Else, add the code:

**slot_options += `<option value=${i}>${label}</option>`**

**Note:** *Make ****sure all the code blocks have appropriate curly braces where necessary.*

## Step 13

Save the file and make sure there are no visible errors inside your HTML file.

Now open the **Terminal** inside VS Code and add a command to run the server and go to the localhost URL and observe the web page.

## Step 14

Enter your name in the text box and select a date and time of your choice to create a reservation.

The screen should appear similar to the screen below:

![Untitled](Exercise%20Display%20the%20Little%20Lemon%20available%20bookin%2046ad228491e140cebe0e39d83d8f2eb2/Untitled.png)

## Step 15

After selecting the options and pressing the **`Reserve Now`** button, you should be able to see the screen updated with your details. Note the times selected earlier are not available for selection.

![Untitled](Exercise%20Display%20the%20Little%20Lemon%20available%20bookin%2046ad228491e140cebe0e39d83d8f2eb2/Untitled%201.png)

## Step 16

Note the change in the content displayed on the screen as per the change in the date selected:

![Untitled](Exercise%20Display%20the%20Little%20Lemon%20available%20bookin%2046ad228491e140cebe0e39d83d8f2eb2/Untitled%202.png)

## Step 17

Open the MySQL database and observe the entries updated in line with the changes in the reservations performed inside the template.

# Conclusion

Part three of the final assessment utilized the functionalities of JavaScript to dynamically process the available time slots and refresh the available updated times. It also provides an update to dynamically reload the template based on date change. You have successfully implemented the Django final assessment to create a reservation form and add JavaScript functionalities to dynamically update a form in a Django project.
