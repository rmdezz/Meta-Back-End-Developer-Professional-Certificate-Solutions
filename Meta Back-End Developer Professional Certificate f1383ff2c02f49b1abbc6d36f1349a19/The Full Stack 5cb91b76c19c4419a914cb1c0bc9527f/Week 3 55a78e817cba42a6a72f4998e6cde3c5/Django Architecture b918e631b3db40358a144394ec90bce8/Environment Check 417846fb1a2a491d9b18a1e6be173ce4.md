# Environment Check

# ****Introduction****

If you set up your full stack development environment with the right tools, you can use your time more effectively during the development process. **By using effective tools, you can make the development process fast and fun.** This reading will introduce you to some essential tools for full stack development.

# The terminal

In full stack development, you must familiarize yourself with using terminals and command-line tools. This is where you can run commands to build Django projects, manage builds and communicate with your server and the database. If you are not using the terminal, you can't use Django, install the dependencies or use JavaScript to properly build tools. In macOS and Linux, you can use the app called terminal and in Windows, you use PowerShell for this purpose.

# Django specific tools

By now you should know that when using Django for your project, **it's always a good idea to avoid using global environments to manage your package dependencies.** Pipenv is a fantastic command line tool that only manages your dependencies but also does so in a virtual environment, avoiding any possible conflicts between the packages. Download it from the  [Pipenv website.](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

# Database

While Django can use SQLite, a file-based database system, it can work with many others. And MySQL and MariaDB are some of the most popular and widely used database engines by developers worldwide. You can install MySQL on your machine using the installer from their website or using the package managers available for your operating system.

# Editor

A good code editor can really speed up your development by providing essential features like debuggers, quick refactoring and syntax highlighting. Additionally, there are many add-ons or extensions that you can install which provide even more functionalities. **Visual Studio Code** is a great editor that has everything you need to start developing in different programming languages. And the best part is, it's free. Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) here.

# API Testing

To test the APIs that you build, you need a REST API client to make different API calls and send JSON or form URL encoded payloads and headers. Postman, Insomnia, and HTTpie are three popular REST clients you can use for free. They are cross-platform and very user-friendly. Here are a few helpful links to get you started with API testing:

- [Postman API platform for building and using APIs](https://www.postman.com/)
- [Postman Echo service to test REST clients and make sample API calls](https://postman-echo.com/)
- [Insomnia homepage](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [Getting started with Insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/get-started)
- [Httpbin HTTP request and response service](https://httpbin.org/)

# Version Control

An effective version control system is a must-have for any full stack developer. Using a version control system like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), you can maintain different versions of your code and you can also roll back to any particular state in the past at any time. **Fortunately, these days version control systems are integrated with the build tools.**

# Front-end tools

When using front-end frameworks like **`React`**, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system to access it from the command line. You also need a package manager like [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to deal with the dependencies and a build tool like [Vite.jsor](https://vitejs.dev/) [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to build the production version of your code. These days, **`Vite`** is a popular and fast building tool you can use for free.

# Conclusion

With the proper development environment, you can make your development journey really enjoyable and productive. The correct tools help you to write quality code fast and avoid common errors. In this reading, you learned what tools you should have in your toolbelt to become an excellent full stack developer.
