# Course syllabus

This course introduces you to API development on a foundational level. You will delve deeper into the processes and concepts behind APIs and their infrastructure.

For instance, you will learn how to build APIs with the Django Rest Framework(DRF). But since DRF is primarily a toolkit built on top of the Django framework, this course assumes that you have a good understanding of basic Django concepts. Like how to work with [views](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/home/week/2), [models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/home/week/3), and [templates](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework/home/week/4). To get the most out of this course, it is a good idea to review these basic concepts in the [Django Web Framework](https://www.coursera.org/learn/django-web-framework?utm_source=mobile&utm_source=link&utm_medium=page_share&utm_content=lih&utm_campaign=card_button) course by Meta.

In this course, each week intends to equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to drive you toward a better understanding of API development.

# Week 1: Rest APIs

In the first week, you will start with an overview of how APIs are used in the real world and a refresher on HTTP and HTTPS before you cover the basics of REST architecture and RESTful APIs.

After completing the lesson items, you will be able to:

- Identify the key characteristics, benefits and uses of REST APIs
- Create API routes according to correct naming conventions and best practices
- Explain the principles of authentication in a REST API
- Differentiate between authentication and authorization
- Explain the API request lifecycle
- Create a basic API and organize an API project
- Explain different types of API output, like JSON and XML
- Use various tools for API development

# Week 2: Django Rest Framework

In the second week, you will learn how to use the Django REST framework to create APIs efficiently, and then you will learn to serialize your database models, convert, validate and render data.

After completing the lesson items, you will be able to:

- Install and set up the Django REST framework in VS Code
- Test APIs straight from the browser using the API view decorator
- Use function and class-based views to create API endpoints efficiently
- Serialize database models using different types of serializers
- Validate input data and then map it to a model using the validation and deserialization process in DRF
- Render API output as JSON and XML data using different types of renderers
- Use throttling and caching to optimize and protect your API
- Create a basic API project using DRF
- Debug your APIs using the debug toolbar

# Week 3: Advanced API development

After familiarizing yourself with the Django REST framework and how to use it, you will focus on more advanced API development. You'll learn more about controlling access to your APIs and how to implement searching, ordering, filtering and pagination to optimize your APIs.

After completing the lesson items, you will be able to:

- Use token-based authentication to optimize access to your APIs for authenticated clients
- Implement API throttling to control how often anonymous and authenticated users can access your APIs
- Explain different ways to implement caching to save API infrastructure resources
- Prevent users from doing anything outside of their privileges using an authorization layer
- Implement search, ordering, filtering and pagination to allow client applications to get access to specific data via your APIs

# Week 4: Graded assessment

In the final week, you'll apply the skills you gained from the course to create and test a Little Lemon restaurant API project with features like order placement and role-based APIs. You will then move on to complete the final graded assessment. After that, you will have the opportunity to reflect on the course content and review the learning path.

After completing the project, you will be able to:

- Develop an API project with Django and DRF for an online ordering application for the Little Lemon restaurant
- Create APIs to register, assign and authenticate different user roles
- Create a suitable database schema for the online ordering application
- Create API endpoints with CRUD operations in the database
- Use filtering, sorting and pagination to optimize the output of your APIs
- Enforce user authentication, role-based operations, and throttling to specify and limit access to your APIs for different user roles
